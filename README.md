This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to understand the key factors that lead customers to stop using a company’s services. The objective was to identify churn patterns, high-risk customer segments, and actionable insights that can help improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

The dataset includes customer demographic details, service usage information, contract types, payment methods, tenure, and churn status. Initial data preprocessing involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and performing feature-level cleaning to ensure data quality and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to uncover trends and relationships within the data. Visual analysis helped identify strong churn indicators such as short customer tenure, month-to-month contracts, and specific service combinations. Several univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to compare churned and retained customers across different attributes.

To strengthen the business analysis, SQL queries were used to segment customers and calculate churn rates based on tenure groups, contract types, payment methods, and service usage. These queries enabled efficient aggregation and filtering of data to answer real-world business questions related to customer behavior.

Key insights from the analysis revealed that customers with shorter tenure and flexible contract types are more likely to churn, while long-term contracts show higher retention. The project concludes with clear, data-driven recommendations aimed at improving customer engagement, optimizing service offerings, and designing targeted retention strategies.

The complete project, including datasets, analysis notebooks, SQL queries, and documentation, is maintained on GitHub to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and easy collaboration.
